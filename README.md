# UPBGE-ArtificialLifeSim
this is WIP. Its not working as as it should yet. it is a hobby project.
I try to simulate natural-selection-sim using bots in UPBGE.
first i need to learn more, to optimize performance and functionality.

so far the simulation includes: 
- a genome inheriting system, that allows the bots to inherit their genes and reproduce
- SpeciesGenerator: this thing shows a representation of the generated values needed to "life" as a bot in the simulation as an insect.


 i would love to see someone have a look on it (and the code), to give me some feedback and tips how to make it better!
